# Introduction

While I hate to agree with Taylor Swift, and I also hate to give money to the rich, I wanted to look more into how much artist actually get from different outlets of selling their music. While the number of plays/purchased items does seem disproportionate to the amount of money the artist recieves, through this study I think that the record companies are more to blame that the systems that supply fans the music. 

To me music is a kind of weird art type commodity; I honestly think that you should be able to pay what you feel the art is worth. 
People interpret art and music in different ways, so people may not think that some forms of music are worth what you pay for them. The fact that these music artists are complaining about making no money off of their music, but still being multi-millionaires is fairly disconcerning. 

# The Test

I explored what I think are the three most common places that people listen/purchase music from to see what type of payments the artists recieve from those companies. While the top 5 songs did vary on the different platforms, I chose to use the top 5 songs of 2014 from iTunes as the constant variable because these were actual sales of the songs. 

First up is iTunes. While the data set I used a price of 99 cents per song, instead of the now standard $1.29 the answer is still fairly similar. This because there is an actual product being sold yields the most profit for the actual artist. The average amount an artist gets per sale is 30%.

I had trouble finding actual numbers for how many times songs were streamed in a specific year. While I believe Spotify's play trackers 
are for every play since the song has been uploaded, I chose the same top songs from iTunes to see how much money the made since they were uploaded on to Spotify, until 11/20/15. The average amount that an artist gets per stream is 0.006%.

Finally, similar to Spotify, YouTube was difficult to find the number of views for one specific year. I used to number of views to the date 11/20/15 to give an estimate on what an artist would make from people viewing their video. Surprisingly, YouTube had the most amount of "interaction" with the media. There were significantly more views on videos than their were purchases or streams of the songs. The average amount a artist gets from each view is 0.002%.

#Conclusion

What I learned from this is that, Taylor Swift is just kind of being greedy because someone as popular as her would stand to make so much money from Spotify. Especially if her whole discography is on there she would make so much money off of Spotify. I still think that artists do need to make money but I think they should be worrying more about their record companies.
